      description: "LWRC M6A2 5.56 16\" Piston - Special Teams Rifle: M6A2R5CK16\r\
        \n\r\n The M6A2 rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths\
        \ and in either 5.56mm NATO or 6.8mm SPC. The M6A2 rifle is ideal for those\
        \ who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There\
        \ is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device.\
        \ The M6A2 rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with\
        \ a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted\
        \ to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge\
        \ devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords\
        \ more 1913 \"real estate\" to mount your accessories.\r\n\r\n The M6A2 rifle's\
        \ edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result\
        \ of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with\
        \ progressive patented designs. All LWRCI carbine systems feature our short-stroke\
        \ gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating,\
        \ and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts\
        \ of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability\
        \ while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2 rifles feature\
        \ a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The\
        \ barrel is treated with NiCorr surface conversion technology that extends\
        \ service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the\
        \ weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension\
        \ of the M6A2 rifle is coated with EXO's patented nickel-boron surface conversion\
        \ technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.\r\
        \n\r\n The M6A2 rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally\
        \ evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best\
        \ value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy\
        \ is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than\
        \ the legacy gas-impingement design.\r\n \r\n \r\n Features\r\n\r\n \r\n Short-Stroke\
