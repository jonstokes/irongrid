      description: |-
        Improving on the FNP-45 Tactical, developed for the U.S. Joint Combat
        Pistol Program, the FNX-45 Tactical is the latest in technological
        advancements in handgun engineering, offering .45 ACP performance and a
        host of unique features that no other handgun can match. The checkered
        polymer frame is offered in Black and Flat Dark Earth and has a low-bore
        axis for reduced felt recoil and enhanced operator control. Two
        interchangeable backstraps come standard to quickly customize the grip
        feel. All operating controls are fully ambidextrous for ease of use. The
        5.3 cold hammer-forged, stainless steel barrel has a threaded muzzle to
        accept sound suppressors, compensators and other accessories. The stainless
        steel slide has high-profile combat night sights and includes two mounting
        bases to accept multiple styles of optional red-dot electronic sights.
