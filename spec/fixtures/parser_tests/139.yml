      description: "Let me tell you about this ammo - Other than the name Wolf on\
        \ the box, there is nothing steel cased, or Russian made about this ammo.\
        \ This fine ammunition is actually manufactured by Privi Partizan, one of\
        \ the most renowned ammo makers in the world. In fact the master cases are\
        \ all still marked Privi partizan as are the headstamps on the shell casings.\
        \ It was purchased as a bulk ammo buy by Wolf and then repackaged by them\
        \ in their commercial boxes as Wolf Gold. This is some really good stuff.\
        \ Brass Cased in annelled casings, boxer primed and fully reloadable, features\
        \ a 150 grain soft point bullet. 2805 FPS.This stuff is affordable enough\
        \ to target shoot but versatile enough to make a fine deer load. Get some\
        \ and give it a try \r\nWe sell it by the individual box with a price break\
        \ at 10 boxes, and another price break at 25 boxes which equals a 500 round\
        \ case."
