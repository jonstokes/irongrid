      description: "We are proud to re - introduce this high quality AR-15 Rifle by\
        \ Moore's Machine Company... Never heard of them, well here is the story.\
        \ Moore's Machine is a very high end manufacturer and full service machine\
        \ company based right here in North Carolina. We have known about them for\
        \ years and they are really good folks. Well. About 3 years ago they started\
        \ building some AR-15 rifles. We watched from afar as they experimented with\
        \ different tooling and went through the learning curve that comes along with\
        \ being a firearms manufacturer. We even carried some of their early rifles\
        \ that were marked as Rocky Point Guns right after they first started manufacturing,\
        \ with mixed results. When I say mixed results the problem was basically this.\
        \ They made a great looking rifle, and the price point and customer service\
        \ was excellent, but in all honesty we did have some returns... Not a lot\
        \ mind you, maybe one out of 20, and typically due to some type of feed issue\
        \ that ( the people at Moore's ) quickly resolved, but still to us any return\
        \ is one too many. So we decided to discontinue the line and wait until they\
        \ had all of the bugs worked out before jumping back in ... Well, we almost\
        \ waited too long... Not only have they overcome any issues that they may\
        \ have had in the past, but the MMC rifles are taking our region by storm...\
        \ In fact they are now so tied up with Law Enforcement and Distributor Orders\
        \ that we had to get in line and beg in order to get some rifles... But the\
        \ payoff was worth it. We have torture tested these rifles and I would put\
        \ them up against anything being sold for reliability... Now don't get me\
        \ wrong... There is nothing fancy here... Just a basic M4 AR-15 Carbine...\
        \ But if you want a great entry level AR, at a really great price.... Give\
        \ this MMC AR-15 a try. Ships complete with a Carbine Length AR-15 Hard case\
        \ and 1-30 round magazine.... Standard M4- Flat Top Rifle.... Note : Rifle\
        \ comes to us as a Flat Top and is sold as such..., at the $699.99 price they\
        \ ship with one 30 round mag in a hard shell case. Some photo's show rifle\
        \ with Rear Sight / Carry Handle, Halographic Electro Sight, or Barska 3x9x40\
        \ Scope Installed. .... These are optional and do not come with the rifle.\
        \ They are shown here for demonstrative purposes only, but must be purchased\
        \ seperately... Scopes, Extra Mags, Drum Mags, etc... may also be purchased\
        \ with the rifle.....Note - The scope you see in the photo's on the rifle\
        \ is a Barska 3x9x40 Colorado series... This is a great scope for the price\
        \ and comes with rings and mounts up to this AR-15 right out of the box....\
        \ The rings it comes with are low profile so it makes for a very low profile\
        \ scope package.... If you like for your scope to ride higher on the riflejust\
        \ replace these factory rings with any medium or high ring set. Also, many\
        \ people ask, do you not see the front sight through the scope??? The answer\
        \ is no.. You do not... I don't know why, it is right there in front of the\
        \ lens... but it does not show up though the scope... You have an unobstructed\
        \ clear as a bell view downrange as far as the eye can see..... It must be\
        \ magic...Note - We have tested these extensively and they work great, however,\
        \ for some reason these rifles do not seem to like the Thermold brand mags...\
        \ We recommend the Tapco, or C-Products mags..... Our Korean Military 100\
        \ round drum mags work great too.\r\nLooking for owners manual? View the PDF\
