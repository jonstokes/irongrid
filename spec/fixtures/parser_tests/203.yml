      description: "AAC's MODEL-7 rifle is chambered in the new 300 AAC BLACKOUT cartridge\
        \ which offers an accurate, light weight, and compact package for hunting\
        \ or target shooting.\r\nThe action is made by Remington to AAC's specifications.\
        \ It has all the features and safety you come to expect from a Model-7 action\
        \ (a shorter version of the Model-700), A 20 MOA scope rail is mounted to\
        \ the receiver using M24 type 8-40 screws. The X-Mark Pro trigger is factory\
        \ set for 3.5 lbs and provides the feel needed for precision shooting. The\
        \ barrel is a 5R 1:7 twist and threaded 5/8-24. A thread protector is included.\
        \ The nitride surface of the barrel, bore, and chamber provide maximum service\
        \ life and durability - longer than even hard-chrome but with the accuracy\
        \ potential of a stainless barrel. Corrosion and wear resistance of the bore\
        \ is extreme.\r\n \r\nAttention!\r\n By Federal law, we can only ship firearms\
        \ to an FFL licensed gun dealer Check all local laws and regulations before\
        \ purchasing"
