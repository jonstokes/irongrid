      description: "Yugo M70 AK-47 Style N-PAP Rifle, 7.62x39, Semi-Auto W / 2 - 30\
        \ Round MagsMade in the same factory that produced top quality rifles for\
        \ former Yugoslavia like the M70B1 and M70AB2, our newly manufactured PAP\
        \ rifles are the semi-auto version of the famous military series M70 rifles.\
        \ These beauties are the latest imports from the world famous Zastava factory.\
        \ This one is the HI-CAP PAP Classic and features a full teak wood stock matching\
        \ fore end wood and an ergonomic pistol grip. It also features a hammer forged\
        \ barrel, specialized safety lever, and factory buttpad. Unlike the first\
        \ batch of imports this new second generation rifle also has a built in side\
        \ rail mount for true hold accuracy when mounting a scope. Rifle features\
        \ a Beautiful Teakwood Stockand forearm and ergonomically shaped molded and\
        \ textured pistol grip. Comes complete with Two Original Yugo 30 round steel\
        \ mags..... Barrel: 16.25\" with a 1:10 twist, Overall: 36.25\", Weight: 7.7\
        \ lbs. Condition: New. Yugo AK rifles are unique in the industry in that they\
        \ have a bolt hold open capability and when used with original Yugo mags will\
        \ lock the bolt back after the last shot is fired. Rifle will of course function\
        \ properly with any AK mag but only the Yugo mag facilitates the bolt hold\
        \ open. Rifle also features an exclusive safety lever design that also acts\
        \ as a bolt lock / hold open for ultimate safety and lightning fast chambering.\
        \ ( See Image ) Rifle comes complete with 2-30 round mags and cleaning rod.\
        \ Mags are surplus and cosmetic condition on the mags included with the rifle\
        \ may vary.Legally accepts all high cap mags and drums regardless of country\
        \ of origin. Receivers are stamped but slightly heavier than typical stamped\
        \ receivers. These are built like tanks.... \r\n If you can only have one\
        \ AK in your Arsenal let me suggest the N-PAP Gen II.\r\nThe Yugo AK's are\
        \ regarded as some of the finest quality AK rifles in the world and these\
        \ are no exception. Extremely well made with very tight tolerances - These\
        \ rifles will feed, function and fire flawlessly for thousands and thousands\
        \ of rounds. \r\nNote - Some images show rifle with optional scope and mount.\
        \ These photo's are informational only to demonstate how rifle accepts scope\
        \ and mount. Scopes, Mounts, and Scope Packages Sold Seperately."
