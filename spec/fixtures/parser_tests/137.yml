      description: "The 3032 Tomcat offers all the features of the 21 Bobcat. Both\
        \ pistols have a snag-proof design that permits quick presentation to the\
        \ target, a slide blade front sight for fast target acquisition, and a smooth,\
        \ crisp trigger pull in double/single action.QUALITY POCKET PISTOLS. The same\
        \ dedication to advanced design, uncompromising quality and strict quality\
        \ control that make the 92FS, Cougar and Cheetah such international standouts\
        \ is found in all Beretta small caliber, pocket-size pistols. Simplicity,\
        \ safety and practical use are their best qualities. PRACTICAL AND SIMPLE.The\
        \ exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly\
        \ into the chamber. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by\
        \ allowing a live round to be easily removed from the chamber and the bore\
        \ quickly checked. Jamming and stovepiping problems are virtually eliminated\
        \ by the open slide design shared by all small frame Berettas. \r\n\r\n1)\
        \ Barrel. Forged out of special high-strength steel; precisely rifled for\
        \ accuracy. The Inox models feature stainless steel barrels.2) Slide. Machined\
        \ out of high-strength carbon steel and specially heat treated.3) Sights.\
        \ Notched rear sight and blade front sight for fast target acquisition.4)\
        \ Frame-mounted. Manual, conveniently thumb operated.5) Contoured Tang. Top\
        \ of the grip area is precisely curved and relieved to snugly accommodate\
        \ the shooter's hand, thus protecting the thumb web from being pinched by\
        \ the slide and increasing the pistol control upon firing.6) Frame. Made of\
        \ a special alloy, noticeably stronger, lighter and more corrosion resistant\
        \ than stainless steel. In all other models the frame is made of special aluminum\
        \ alloy forgings and anodized black or gray.7) Tip-up Barrel Latch.8) Trigger\
        \ Pull. Smooth, crisp pull in double/single action. 9) Snag Proof Design.\
        \ Smooth contours permit quick, smooth draw.\r\n 3032 TOMCAT. EXCELLENT POWER\
        \ VS WEIGHT.Stopping power, concealability and lightweight -- that's what\
        \ the double-action Tomcat is all about. Using 60-grain .32 ACP (7.65 mm)\
        \ hollow-point ammunition, this latest addition to Beretta's small frame collection\
        \ provides firepower equalling the punch of a .380 (9mm Short). Yet, all this\
        \ serious capability is packed into a compact, lightweight 4.9\" (125 mm),\
        \ 14.5 ounce (400 gr.) package. A drift-adjustable rear sight provides for\
        \ superior accuracy. Available in the Tritium version featuring the tritium\
        \ luminous front sight in some countries. 3032 TOMCAT INOX.This new model\
        \ has a stainless steel slide and barrel. The alloy frame is gray anodized\
        \ to match the color and finish of the stainless components. The trigger,\
        \ hammer, safety, magazine and other parts are blued. All other features are\
        \ the same as the Tomcat. \n \n UPC\n 0082442111070\n decorateTable('product-attribute-specs-table')"
