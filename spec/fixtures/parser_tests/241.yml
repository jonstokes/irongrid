      description: "Adcor Defense 2013140 B.E.A.R. GI Semi-Auto 223 Rem 16\" 30+1\
        \ Adj Stk Black B.E.A.R. (Brown Enhanced Automatic Rifle) models from Adcor\
        \ Defense feature a toolless field strip design, so a B.E.A.R. requires nothing\
        \ more than a firing pin to disassemble, yet remains strong. The GI offers\
        \ a gas impingement system coupled with Adcor's innovative designs. The GI\
        \ has a multi-position gas regulator with a removable gas tube. The ejection\
        \ port wiper prevents the entry of dust, sand and other debris by moving into\
        \ the ejection port opening flush with the inside geometry of the upper receiver.\
        \ The spring-loaded shield allows the bolt carrier to return to ready position.\
        \ Being made of a highly-durable, self-lubricating polymer helps the shield\
        \ withstand temperature extremes. The B.E.A.R. GI series features a 16\" chrome-lined\
        \ barrel from Green Mountain, button-broached with a 1:7 twist. It has a two-piece\
        \ key-locked, highly-rigid quad-rail system made of aircraft-grade 7075-T6\
        \ aluminum alloy that seamlessly mounts to the upper receiver which is made\
        \ from the same aircraft-grade 7075-T6 aluminum alloy. The upper and lower\
        \ rails separate with the push of a button - no special tools required. The\
        \ B.E.A.R. GI series features a stock adjustable from 36.25\" down to 32.5,\"\
        \ and total weight with Magpul magazine loaded with 30 rounds of M855 ammo\
        \ is 7.9 lbs. These models both come optics-ready and are available with (3040)\
        \ or without (3140) the forward-placed, ambidextrous charging handle.\r\n\
