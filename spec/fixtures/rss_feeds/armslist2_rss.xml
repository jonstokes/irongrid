I'll be in Duluth on Saturday so I'm willing to potentially meet up there to sell.

   <title>(Cincinnati) 1951 Russian SKS w. Knife-Type Bayonet - $ 499</title>
   <link>http://www.armslist.com/posts/2895022</link>
   <description>This rifle is a hard to find Russian-Made SKS (not Chinese / Yugo) made in Russia in 1951 at the Tula Armory.  Knife-type folding bayonet.  Actual Hardwood stock.  I've had it nearly 15 years and only had it out to the range 4X for a total of about 150 rounds fired through it.  Comes w. standard 10 shot mag + some stripper clips I can include.  Cleaning kit that is stored in the butt of the rifle.  Weapon functions great.  Its a really fun gun.  Fires standard 7.62 X 39 rounds of course.  Only selling to fund another project (AK47).   Make a cash offer or willing to trade for an AK...  I can add some $ as well if needed.  Please keep in mind this is Russian version when considering offers / trades.  Thx for looking.</description>
